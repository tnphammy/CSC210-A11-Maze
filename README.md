## Reflection

Do you have any remaining questions about this assignment? No.

In phase four, what method did you choose to store the extra data?  Why did you make this choice?
- The Hashtable was my drink of choice because, upon reviewing the lecture slides, I saw that a Hashtable/HashMap took among the best runtime to insert and replace/update distance - O(1).
- Another frank reason is that I'm very bad with numbers and directions, and using another 2D array would've been too much of a struggle.
- Using a Hashtable, I could follow our lecture slides and really have a good grasp on what I was doing.

Reflection on your experience with this assignment: 

- It was an excrutiating process and it made me think about the layers of recursion that can affect the process, especially when there are more than a couple directions to explore. Also, I think it's awesome that humans can think of how to solve a maze – this is a practice I and my friends have been able to do since we were kids... and to think we were doing Breadth-first Search?? The human mind is very interesting and I'm sure the way we write code and algorithms is very revealing of that.
- This is kind of random but I didn't realize you can make a class inside of a class?? I'm sure you know this already haha, but until TA Jade Lilian pointed it out as a potential solution, I was really scared that I couldn't implement a Hashtable because I needed a cost and via (2 things - and there's only 1 value per key). This was eye-opening!!
