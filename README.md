## Reflection

Do you have any remaining questions about this assignment? No.

In phase four, what method did you choose to store the extra data?  Why did you make this choice?

Reflection on your experience with this assignment: It was an excrutiating process and it made me think about the layers of recursion that can affect the process, especially when there are more than a couple directions to explore. Also, I think it's awesome that humans can think of how to solve a maze – this is a practice I and my friends have been able to do since we were kids... and to think we were doing Breadth-first Search?? The human mind is very interesting and I'm sure the way we write code and algorithms is very revealing of that.
